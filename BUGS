This is the first, yes, the first C program I ever wrote. if you're a 
seasoned C programmer, and you're ROTFL over my code, please write me
<joey@kite.ml.org>, and give me a hand!

Current bugs:
	I'm sure there are spelling errors throughout. Too bad.

	Home/End don't work in my xterm. This is probably a problem with my 
	terminfo file for xterm.
