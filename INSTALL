                        Compilation and Installation

Quick Start:
	If you're in a hurry to see Pdmenu, just run "make test" now --
	pdmenu will be compiled, and will run on a sample pdmenurc file.
	Then, read the rest of this file. :-)

Libraries:
	To compile Pdmenu, you need the S-Lang library. This can be
	found at ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/

	Optionally, if you wish to compile pdmenu with mouse support, you
	need to install the GPM library. Find it on a linux ftp site near 
	you.

Configuration:
	Pdmenu uses an autoconf configure script. Typically, if you want
	the pdmenu binary installed in /usr/bin, and the pdmenurc file
	installed in /etc, you should type:

		./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

	To get a list of all the possible arguments the configure script can
	use, type:

		./configure --help

	Note that if you have slang installed in a nonstandard location, you 
	might need to set two variables before you are run ./configure in 
	the next step:

		SLANG_LIB_LOC	Set this to the directory where the slang
				libraries are located.
		SLANG_H_LOC	Set this to the filename where slang.h is
				located.

	After running configure, you might want to take a look at
	makeinfo, which is part of Pdmenu's makefile - there are a few
	options you can turn on there. You can also look at
	src/config.h and modify some things there. This is optional.

Compilation:
	Pdmenu has been compiled on many flavors of Unix. You shouldn't 
	have any problems with those OS's, but for others, you're on your 
	own. If you get it to work on something else, please let me know.

	To build Pdmenu, type:

		make

Testing:
	To try out the program before installing it, type:
	
		make test

Installation:
	To install Pdmenu, become root and type:

		make install
