                        Compilation and Installation

Libraries:	
	To compile Pdmenu, you need the S-Lang library. This can be 
	found at ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/

	Optionally, if you wish to compile pdmenu with mouse support, you
	need to install the GPM library. Find it on a linux ftp site near 
	you.

Configuration:
	Pdmenu uses an autoconf configure script. Typically, if you want
	the pdmenu binary installed in /usr/bin, and the pdmenurc file
	installed in /etc, you should type:

		./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

	To get a list of all the possible arguments the configure script can
	use, type:

		./configure --help

Compilation:
	I've only compiled Pdmenu on Linux systems. I don't anticipate any
	compilation problems under Linux, but for other *nix's, you're on 
	your own. If you get it to work on something else, please let me 
	know.

	To build Pdmenu, type:

		make

Testing:
	To try out the program before installing it, type:
	
		make test

Installation:
	To install Pdmenu, become root and type:

		make install


Report any problems to me, <joey@kite.ml.org>.

Please see the README and man page for more information about Pdmenu.
