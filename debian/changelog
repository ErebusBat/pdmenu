pdmenu (1.2.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct urls to current location of the web page.
  * Remove some urls for downloading the source etc that are no longer valid.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 04 Jun 2007 16:46:53 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.89) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add config.sub/config.guess update code to the debian/rules clean
    target. Closes: #379702

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Jul 2006 11:44:43 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.88) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add links to svn.
  * debhelper v5, current policy.
  * Add !kfreebsd-any arch specifier to the libgpmg1-dev build dep.
    Closes: #377792
  * Deal with install-menu moving.
  * Dummied up debian changelog format for first changelog entries, which
    predated that format. My, lintian is getting picky.

pdmenu (1.2.87) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Return of the Shadows
    (thanks JED, apologies JMS)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jul 2005 09:22:01 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.86) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to slang 2.
  * Since slang 2 has removed SLSMG_BUILD_CHAR which was used to add shadows
    to characters, the shadow code was changed to just draw solid black
    shadows that do not display the shadowed code underneath.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jun 2005 14:18:37 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.85) unstable; urgency=low

  * First translation, to French. Closes: #253877
  * Fixed mo file building and installation.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Jun 2004 13:09:58 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.84) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Martin Quinson to avoid use of string concatenation and make
    life easier for translators. Closes: #252322
  * Fix segfault introduced by above patch.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Jun 2004 14:59:34 -0300

pdmenu (1.2.83) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch to add a new helptext command. Thanks, John Daley.
  * Move the stdin reopening hack to rc.c, so it is done only if a rc file
    was read from stdin. Reverted the earlier change, so it opens /dev/tty
    again. This will break on non-unix98 pty systems (linux without /dev/pts),
    but at least it will work better than the old thing, which did not work at
    all.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Dec 2003 19:41:10 -0500

pdmenu (1.2.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "lynx style" menu navigation, using left and right arrow keys.
    Closes: #197274

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Aug 2003 16:42:14 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.81) unstable; urgency=low

  * At suggestion of Bill Allombert, redo debian menu support, so there are
    three separate menu-methods, that generate three separate menus, for text,
    x11, and vc. /etc/pdmenurc then just inlcudes whichever ones is
    appropriate for the environment, no nasty cpp.pl hacks. This will also
    play nicer with menu's hints and collapsing code, since menu will know
    what items are really in each menu.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 27 May 2003 21:49:37 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix from Lou Sortman for bug if an _ was escaped, and then a hotkey placed
    later on the line. Sorry I took so long Lou!

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 12 May 2003 14:15:09 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.79) unstable; urgency=low

  * Detect 2 queued escapes and assume the first one is a literal escape.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Mar 2003 17:24:57 -0800

pdmenu (1.2.78) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed some problems with sample menus in pdmenurc(5). Closes: #183978
  * Don't call Screen_Init on startup until after initting gpm. I think that
    gpm_init was overriding the resize signal or something. Anyway, this fixes
    resizes in xterm, as mentioned in #116599.
  * Fix doubled conffiles.
  * Hacked ba.lpd example script in truely evil way to make dash -n prse it
    ok.
  * Update config.guess and config.sub.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Mar 2003 17:33:47 -0500

pdmenu (1.2.77) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --with-gpm/--without-gpm to configure script.
  * In debian/rules, configure gpm out on s/390, since it seems that gpm
    crashes pdmenu there, and gpm makes little sense on s/390's consoles.
    Closes: #165560
  * No need to build-dep on libgpm for s390.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Oct 2002 20:32:32 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.76) unstable; urgency=low

pdmenu (1.2.74) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Debhelper v4.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Jun 2002 19:37:29 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.70) unstable; urgency=low

  * De-escape "\:" in prompt titles. Closes: #146727
  * Only accept Enter when pausing after a program run, to prevent
    input typed ahead at the program (eg, down key in less) from accidentually
    triggering it. Closes: #145616
  * Updated to use debhelper v4.
  * Updated to new autoconf.
  * Moved non-substituted stuff from makeinfo to Makefile.
  * Properly gettextized, rather than the wierd strings.h I made up way back
    when. Translations, anyone?

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 22 May 2002 14:01:09 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.69) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed -fstrict-protoypes since gcc 3.0 does not understand it (why?)
    Closes: #104615
  * Made it build clean on gcc 3.0.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Jul 2001 23:26:26 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.68) unstable; urgency=low

  * Need to rebuild pdmenu now that slang has gone back to non-multibyte
    because the shadow code uses macros that determine if it is multibyte
    or not at compile time. A versioned build dep makes sure all the ports
    will build with the right version. This fixes shadows yet again.
  * Gpm is not used for the hurd. 
  * BTW, pdmenu's gpm support at the linux console on devfs systems is
    broken; this is a bug in gpm.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Jun 2001 21:45:09 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.67) unstable; urgency=low

  * Shadows are fixed, thanks to Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS <edmundo@rano.org>
  * May only work with recent versions of slang now, though.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 14 May 2001 22:53:07 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.66) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use printf in pdmenurc.debian, not echo -e, so it will work with ash.
  * Copyright updates.
  * Added a title command to the pdmenurc after several user requests.
  * Compiles cleanly with -Wall once more, there were some prototype
    changes in slang.
  * Lost the yellow on red text ("pleasing color scheme"?? what was I
    thinking?)
  * Damn and blast. Debian's patching of slang for wide character set
    support has gone and broken my shadow code, and I don't know how to fix
    it. I've reverted to stupid shadows in the Debian binary. :-(

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 May 2001 17:08:38 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.65) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Jan Rafaj <Jan.Rafaj@cedric.vabo.cz> to make it
    open the actual tty, not /dev/tty, if a pdmenurc file is read on stdin.
    The issue is that if /dev/tty is used, child processes use it for
    stdin/out, which, while it should work ok, can yeild confusing behavior
    if you're playing around with ttyname().

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Sep 2000 10:14:01 -0700

pdmenu (1.2.64) unstable; urgency=low

pdmenu (1.2.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch from Kees Schoenmakers <KeesS@milltronics.com>
    that is supposed to fix a problem where pdmenu spins in the background
    if the xterm it was running in is closed. I cannot reproduce this one
    myself.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Aug 2000 22:02:29 -0700

pdmenu (1.2.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * Conflicts with older versions of menu that don't support onlyrunasroot.
    Closes: #56744
  * This version will depend on recent versions of libgpm1g, fixing a
    reported segfault with older versions. Closes: #56748

pdmenu (1.2.60) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified spec file so it will work with .tar.gz files that do not
    include the version number. I am currently generating that type of
    tarball.
  * Merged potato branch. (Words archealogists of the future will long ponder).

pdmenu (1.2.58) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Ok, the signal blocking added in the last version just breaks other
    things, so I have reverted it entirely. This version is identical
    to 1.2.56 except for the changelog. Closes: #55651
  * This should go in frozen, since 1.2.57 is broken pretty bad, and this is
    just a reversion to an earlier version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Jan 2000 16:13:19 -0800

pdmenu (1.2.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Block signals before running command, so if it receives a signal while
    the command it running, it doesn't wake up and fight with the command for
    the tty.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Jan 2000 12:49:53 -0800

pdmenu (1.2.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed /var/lib/pdmenu/pdmenurc_auto to .pdmenurc_auto. Had to do this
    so if we have a per-user .pdmenurc_auto, it actually has that name, not
    pdmenurc_auto.
  * Added a compatability symlink it /var/lib/pdmenu/ so pdmenurc files that
    use the old pdmenurc_auto name will keep working.
  * Modified /etc/pdmenurc to use the new name.

    <jeff.covey@pobox.com>

    program instead of cpp for parsing /var/lib/pdmenu/pdmenurc_auto.
    Using plain cpp had undesirable side effects.

    standard functions.
  * Got rid of sinclude in Makefile (changed to include), for portability.
  * For portability, make sure the -L comes before the -lslang.
  * Added setenv() code, to be used if setenv is not otherwise available. The
    code is from: ftp://ftp.uu.net/systems/unix/bsd-sources/lib/libc/stdlib/

pdmenu (1.2.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uses debhelper to build.
  * Fix a bug in how putenv is used. Unfortunatly, this introduces a memory
    leak. Modified configure script to detect if setenv is present and use
    it instead if possible, eliminating the problem for linux systems.
  * Rename getline to pdgetline.
  * Allow use of RunSetEnv even if we don't have putenv or setenv, so you
    can still do chdir.

pdmenu (1.2.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor optimzations to CalcMenu, pdstrtok.
  * getline: remove trailing \n always.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Fixed binary-indep target.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Sep 1997 16:22:24 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a memory leak.
  * Modified menu methods file so debian menus are always available, even
    during pdmenu install.
  * /var/lib/pdmenu/pdmenurc_auto is no longer part of the package.
  * /etc/pdmenurc modified so it does not display an error if
    /var/lib/pdmenu/pdmenurc_auto is not present.

pdmenu (1.2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed more arbitrary limits: no more limit on size of menu item text,
    menu item command, or rc file line length, or on the length of strings
    pdmenu uses for any other purpose.
  * Fixed bug when there was no \n at eof of a pdmenurc file.
  * Use SLsmg_Tab_Width when appropriate.
  * Made pdmenu resize immediately. (Something of a hack..)
  * Fixed rare crash on resize.
  * Unified error handling.
  * Fixed makefile problem (listed .c files by accident, not .o files)
  * Only suggests, not recommends, menu and cpp.
  * Rebuilt with fixed gpm library, to fix dependancies. (#11593)
  * Fixed some other problems using checker. What a godsend..
    - SelHotKey was not skipping items with no hotkey.
    - Menu flags were not always initialized properly, with odd results.
    - ShowMessage was not setting item->type on all menu items.
    - RunShow was overflowing a string.
  * Checker seems happy with pdmenu now.
  * If a exec:{display,truncate} command returns no output, display the error
    message on the status bar, not in a window.
  * Changed behavior of exec:setenv command - now it parses the first line of
    output, not the last.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Jul 1997 20:37:03 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.15) unstable; urgency=low

pdmenu (1.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * showdir.pl: sort directory listing.
  * RunShow: handle tabs in input.
  * I thought I'd already done this, but turn off mouse support immediatly if 
    it doesn't initalize, so if pdmenu crashes or is killed, cut and paste 
    isn't messed up.
  * I thought I'd done this too (did I lose a version somewhere?), but fixed
    a problem in ShowMessage that was leading to frequent crashes.
  * Code reorganization.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Only run sudo when really necessary - makes fakeroot work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jul 1997 13:49:45 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a crash if the menu file was a single "nop".
  * Built with new gpm library, so it is now entirely libc6, not libc5 and
    libc6 mixed.
  * Fixed a bug in ShowMessage()

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  1 Jul 1997 11:50:23 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged changes from menu package pdmenu example menu method. Now it
    includes menu.h, so you can toggle between long and short titles easily.
  * So that can work, updated to recommend menu >= 1.4
  * Fixed problem with debian menus that was preventing urls from being used
    in menu items, becuase cpp thought everything after "//" was a comment.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Jun 1997 14:16:43 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed debian menu method to not allow +, -, 2, or 8 to be used as 
    hotkeys, since they can be used for navigation.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Jun 1997 14:32:20 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt to use libc6.

pdmenu (1.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure script no longer uses perl to figure out the version number.

pdmenu (1.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

    week.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  5 Jun 1997 16:25:28 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added group commands. These are menu items that execute more than one
    pdmenu command when selected.
  * The makemenu flag no longer displays the menu it makes. If you used this
    feature, you must change your pdmenurc file to run a group command
    that runs the makemenu command and then runs a show command to display
    the menu.
  * This fixes a bug in the makemenu flag if the generated menu is empty.
  * Changed remove to be a command that can appear only in menus and groups.
    Also, remove command has a (currently unused) flags field now, and a
    description field.

    yet really fixed).

    Run dpkg-gencontrol after debstd, and delete substvars during clean.
  * Fixed column mis-align in --help text.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 22 May 1997 13:23:04 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of pdmenu-genmenu. Replaced with a menu-method file that depends
    on menu 1.0 or greater.
  * Previously, if a menu was defined twice, the second definition could add
    items to the menu, but would not change the title or help text of the 
    menu. Now, it does change the title and help text.
  * It is no longer a fatal error for a menu to be completly empty. (Such
    menus are now ignored.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 1997 22:40:23 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * '\' can now be used to escape out ':' characters in pdmenurc files.
  * Patch from Peter Tobias <tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de> to fix bug in 's'
    flag.

  * Reorganized the sample pdmenurc files.
  * Added a pdmenurc.complex that shows off the more advanced features.

  * Fixed problem with debian menu generation: if a command had
    "text","x11", or "vc" in its name, there were problems.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Mar 1997 21:56:03 -0500

  	* Fix CFLAGS in Makefile.

  * Improved line wrapping when displaying command output in a window.
  * Added 't' flag, which is the same as 'd', but truncates command output.

    	* Test if compiler is gcc. If not, don't set some CFLAGS values.

pdmenu (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * 0.3	3rd public release				21JUN96
 		Removed "-n" flag. Now, color is off by default. To turn it
 			on, either use the "-c" flag, or set the COLORTERM 
 			environment variable. (Setting COLORTERM has the side 
 			effect of making color work properly in jed, slrn, and 
 			maybe other programs that use the slang library.)
 		"make config" now works even if you only have perl 4.x, not
 			just 5.x
 		Ctrl-r forces a screen redraw.
 		Split config.h up into lots of little .h files, should make
 			it easier to configure different things.

 		Commands that return null output can be run with the 'w'
 			flag without problems.	
 		Added "nop" command for a blank line in the menu.

  * 0.3pre5 More bugfixing					11MAR96
 		Kept it from stomping on $HOME. (oops..)
 		Fixed key handling, although it's still far from perfect.
 		Added home and end key handling.
 		Other minor fixes.
 
  * 0.3pre4	Bugfix and minor improvements			27JAN96

 		Fixed ShowMessage to work with broken gcc.

  * 0.3pre1	The need for speed				10JAN96
 		**IMPORTANT** This version is a total rewrite in C. It is
 		like the earlier versions in spirit only. There are sure to
 		be lots of bugs, and there is no support for configurable
 		menu colors in this version. However, it's now MUCH faster,
 		and easier to use, with loads of new options.
 
  * 0.2	The enevitable bugfix				02DEC95
 		Added support for multiple menu files being used at once.
 			Just specify them all as parameters.
 		Got rid of the width item in the menu definitions.
 		Because of conflicts with multiple other programs named
 			"menu", the Makefile now installs it as pdmenu
 			instead. See INSTALL for details.
 		Added support for different colored menus.
 		Added a background title to the menus.
 		Fixed bug in detection of menus.
 
  * 0.1     First public release                            26NOV95
