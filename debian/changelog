 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 18 Jul 1997 17:23:42 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * showdir.pl: sort directory listing.
  * RunShow: handle tabs in input.
  * I thought I'd already done this, but turn off mouse support immediatly if 
    it doesn't initalize, so if pdmenu crashes or is killed, cut and paste 
    isn't messed up.
  * I thought I'd done this too (did I lose a version somewhere?), but fixed
    a problem in ShowMessage that was leading to frequent crashes.
  * Code reorganization.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Only run sudo when really necessary - makes fakeroot work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jul 1997 13:49:45 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a crash if the menu file was a single "nop".

    libc6 mixed.
  * Fixed a bug in ShowMessage()

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue,  1 Jul 1997 11:50:23 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged changes from menu package pdmenu example menu method. Now it
    includes menu.h, so you can toggle between long and short titles easily.
  * So that can work, updated to recommend menu >= 1.4
  * Fixed problem with debian menus that was preventing urls from being used
    in menu items, becuase cpp thought everything after "//" was a comment.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 26 Jun 1997 14:16:43 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed debian menu method to not allow +, -, 2, or 8 to be used as 
    hotkeys, since they can be used for navigation.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 25 Jun 1997 14:32:20 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt to use libc6.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 23 Jun 1997 22:31:41 -0400

  * configure script no longer uses perl to figure out the version number.

pdmenu (1.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --retro command line option that makes pdmenu use the pre-1.2.4 
    look.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jun 1997 12:44:22 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed some buffer overflows.
  * Fixed overoptimization that had weird results with empty menus.
  * NOP's are now allowed as the first item in a menu.
  * Fixed a bug with menu items with an empty text field.
  * Fixed longstanding bug that there was no \n after the "Press enter to
    return to pdmenu." prompt.
  * Made flags case-insensitive.
  * Fixed resizing if an item is added to a menu on the fly.

    week.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  5 Jun 1997 16:25:28 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added group commands. These are menu items that execute more than one
    pdmenu command when selected.
  * The makemenu flag no longer displays the menu it makes. If you used this
    feature, you must change your pdmenurc file to run a group command
    that runs the makemenu command and then runs a show command to display
    the menu.
  * This fixes a bug in the makemenu flag if the generated menu is empty.
  * Changed remove to be a command that can appear only in menus and groups.
    Also, remove command has a (currently unused) flags field now, and a
    description field.
  * Fixed a memory leak in the remove command.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 26 May 1997 15:35:24 -0400

    yet really fixed).
  * Added a make dep target.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Run dpkg-gencontrol after debstd, and delete substvars during clean.
  * Fixed column mis-align in --help text.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 22 May 1997 13:23:04 -0400

pdmenu (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug in the postinst, that would cause a failure if a version of
    menu older than 1.0 was installed when pdmenu installs.
  * move compat= in menu method to first non-comment line, at request from
    Joost.

pdmenu (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of pdmenu-genmenu. Replaced with a menu-method file that depends
    on menu 1.0 or greater.
  * Previously, if a menu was defined twice, the second definition could add
    items to the menu, but would not change the title or help text of the 
    menu. Now, it does change the title and help text.
  * It is no longer a fatal error for a menu to be completly empty. (Such
    menus are now ignored.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 1997 22:40:23 -0400

  * '\' can now be used to escape out ':' characters in pdmenurc files.
  * Patch from Peter Tobias <tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de> to fix bug in 's'
    flag.
  * Increaded size of MENU_ITEM_COMMANDSIZE to 512 characters.
  * Reorganized the sample pdmenurc files.
  * Added a pdmenurc.complex that shows off the more advanced features.
  * Reorganized pdmenurc(5).

    	* Test if compiler is gcc. If not, don't set some CFLAGS values.

0.3	3rd public release				21JUN96
		Removed "-n" flag. Now, color is off by default. To turn it
			on, either use the "-c" flag, or set the COLORTERM 
			environment variable. (Setting COLORTERM has the side 
			effect of making color work properly in jed, slrn, and 
			maybe other programs that use the slang library.)
		"make config" now works even if you only have perl 4.x, not
			just 5.x
		Ctrl-r forces a screen redraw.
		Split config.h up into lots of little .h files, should make
			it easier to configure different things.

0.3pre6 Final bugfix					15JUN96
		'p' flag works again (oops...)
		Revamped rc file processing.
		Control and high-bit characters in menus are changed to spaces.
		Tab characters in menus/windows are ok now.
		Avoided making color combos that blink on the linux console 
			be the default colors.
		Allowed default colors to be configured in config.h
		Commands that return null output can be run with the 'w'
			flag without problems.	
		Added "nop" command for a blank line in the menu.

0.3pre5 More bugfixing					11MAR96
		Kept it from stomping on $HOME. (oops..)
		Fixed key handling, although it's still far from perfect.
		Added home and end key handling.
		Other minor fixes.

0.3pre4	Bugfix and minor improvements			27JAN96
		No shadows in B&W mode, faster scrolling on slow terminals, 
			and other cosmetic fixes.
		Fixed nasty problem with menus greater than 127 lines long.
		Fixed ShowMessage to work with broken gcc.
		's' flag to exec command to set environment variables.
		More robust parsing of rc file.
		Sped up screen redraws, thanks to John E. Davis, author of
			S-LANG.
		Fixed make config.

0.3pre3	Creeping featureitus				18JAN96
		Fixed 'd' without 'n' flag so it'll not segfault.
		'e' flag to exec command to let you enter text.
		'd' flag to exec command to display output of command in a
			window.
		Configurable colors via the "color" command.
		Menus can now contain more items than will fit on the
			screen; they scroll.

0.3pre2	Bugfix						11JAN96
		Created autoconfig script ("make config").
		Lots and lots of bugs fixed.
		Added -n and -q switches.

0.3pre1	The need for speed				10JAN96
		**IMPORTANT** This version is a total rewrite in C. It is
		like the earlier versions in spirit only. There are sure to
		be lots of bugs, and there is no support for configurable
		menu colors in this version. However, it's now MUCH faster,
		and easier to use, with loads of new options.

0.2	The enevitable bugfix				02DEC95
		Added support for multiple menu files being used at once.
			Just specify them all as parameters.
		Got rid of the width item in the menu definitions.
		Because of conflicts with multiple other programs named
			"menu", the Makefile now installs it as pdmenu
			instead. See INSTALL for details.
		Added support for different colored menus.
		Added a background title to the menus.
		Fixed bug in detection of menus.
