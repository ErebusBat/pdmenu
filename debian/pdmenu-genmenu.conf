# This is the config file for pdmenu-genmenu, which automatically generates
# debian menus for pdmenu. This file is read by perl, so it has to contain
# valid perl code.

# Values that can appear in the "needs" field of menu items we know how
# to deal with. Order is important! If a program can be run in 2 different
# ways (ie, x11 and text) the one that is listed first will be used.
@needs=('x11','vc','text');

# $needs_append is a hash that sets test to be appeneded to the exec
# commands in the menu for different values of needs.
$needs_append{x11}=" >/dev/null 2>&1 &"; # run x programs in background.

# $needs_execflags is a hash that sets flags passed to the exec commands
# in the menu for different vaules of needs.
$needs_execflags{x11}='n'; # don't clear screen for x commands.

# Where to save the autogenerated system-wide menufile:
$menufile_root='/var/lib/pdmenu/pdmenurc_auto';

# Where to save the autogenerated user-only menufile:
$menufile_user=$ENV{HOME}.'/.pdmenurc_auto';

# The name of the root menu entry to create. All submenus will be below
# this.
