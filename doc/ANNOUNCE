Subject: pdmenu 1.0.0 - simple text mode menu system
Followup-to: comp.os.linux.misc

Pdmenu is a menu system for Unix. It is designed to be easy to use,
and is suitable for a login shell for inexperienced users, or it can
just be run at the command line as a handy menu program.

Pdmenu features color support and, GPM mouse support at the linux
console. It compiles on Linux and Sun and maybe other Unixes.

I was prompted to write Pdmenu when I took a look at a shell script 
that used dialog to generate similar menus. The shell script was 
huge, complicated, and ugly, and had to be modified manually to add 
anything to the menu. I hope that Pdmenu is better. :-)
