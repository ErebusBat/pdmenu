Subject: Pdmenu 1.2.30 - simple text mode menu system
Followup-to: comp.os.linux.misc

Pdmenu is a menu system for Unix. It is designed to be easy to use,
and is suitable for a login shell for inexperienced users, or it can
just be run at the command line as a handy menu program.

Pdmenu features color support and, GPM mouse support at the Linux
console. It compiles on Linux and a variety of other Unix's.

I was prompted to write Pdmenu when I took a look at a shell script 
that used dialog to generate similar menus. The shell script was 
huge, complicated, and ugly, and had to be modified manually to add 
anything to the menu. I hope that Pdmenu is better. :-)

I have just released Pdmenu 1.2.30. The biggest change in this new version
of Pdmenu is that it no longer has hard coded limits of any sort. Now you
can load up any number of menus of any length.

Other changes since Pdmenu version 1.0.0 include:

* Much nicer looking shadows under windows.
* Menus that are not active now change to a different color and lose
  some decorations. (The old behavior can be re-enabled with the
  --retro command line parameter.)
* Added a --lowbit command line parameter, which forces pdmenu to not use
  high bit ascii line drawing characters.
* Added --menu= option to jump to a submenu on startup.
* Added --unpark option, which lets the cursor move to the selected line
  on a menu, to make pdmenu more friendly to speech generation software.
* Introduced a new easy to understand long form for the flags to the exec
  command.
* Added group commands. These are menu items that execute more than one
  pdmenu command when selected. For example, you could make a group command
  that runs a program, pops up a submenu, and when the submenu closes, exits
  pdmenu.
* If you run pdmenu in a xterm, and resize the xterm, pdmenu will immediately
  resize now.
* Fixed a large number of buffer overflows and memory leaks and other bugs.
* Portability fixes for building on other Unix's.
* Added several contributed example pdmenurc files to showcase some of the
  capabilities of pdmenu.
* Optimizations.
