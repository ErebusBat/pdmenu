This is the first, yes, the first C program I ever wrote. if you're a 
seasoned C programmer, and you're ROTFL over my code, please write me
<joey@kitenet.net>, and give me a hand or just some constructive criticizm.

If you want to report a bug, first visit the pdmenu web site
(http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/pdmenu/) and check that the latest version of
pdmenu has the bug. Most bug reports I get have already been fixed, and the
bug reporter is just using an outdated pdmenu. Once you verify there is
still a bug, mail <joey@kitenet.net>, describing how to reproduce the bug.
Please tell me the versions of pdmenu, slang, and what operating system you
are using, along with the pdmenurc file that caused the problem and any other
pertinent information.

Current known bugs:
	I'm sure there are spelling errors throughout. Too bad.

	Run a program that has the pause flag set. At the press any key to
	continue prompt, resize the screen. The screen ends up sized wrong
	when you get back to pdmenu.

	In an rc file, a '\' on a line by itself with no continuation lines
	just before it will not be stripped out.

	When using pdmenurc.complex to view a file with tabs, ie, INSTALL, 
	some lines are missing their last character.
