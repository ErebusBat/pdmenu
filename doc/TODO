Yet to be done:
	* A menu file editor, to make it easy for you to set up your own 
		menus.
	* Break out a general widget library.
	* Scrollbars on menus.
	* Autodetect if terminal supports color
	* Handle BS characters properly, so man pages can be displayed in 
		windows. This would be nasty to do, and the benefit is 
		small...
	* There are some ugly loops in DoMenu_Up and DoMenu_Down that could 
		be eliminated by careful programming.
	* Support arrow keys, etc in inputbox.
	* SIGSTP handler, so ^Z suspends (when not in -q mode)
	* Possible: add an immediate command that takes another command that
	  normally only appears in a menu as its parameter and runs it 
	  immediatly. ie, immediate:remove:::menuid
	* Add an option for a help text for each command in the menu,
          displayed on help line. (Defaults to on, but can be turned off for
          slow terminals.)
	* Use checker's garbage collector to find all leaks.
	* Rewrite RunShow. There has to be a better way.
	* When esc is hit while editing something, back out only one edit
	  step, instead of going all the way back to the menu.
