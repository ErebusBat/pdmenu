Yet to be done:
	* A menu file editor, to make it easy for you to set up your own 
		menus.
	* Break out a general widget library.
	* Better shadows on menus.
	* Scrollbars on menus.
	* Autodetect if terminal supports color
	* Make windows in the background grey or some other color to be less
	        confusing.
	* Handle BS characters properly, so man pages can be displayed in 
		windows. This would be nasty to do, and the benefit is 
		small...
	* There are some ugly loops in DoMenu_Up and DoMenu_Down that could 
		be eliminated by careful programming.
	* Support arrow keys, etc in inputbox.
	* Make the menu array be a dynamic array so there can be unlimited 
		numbers of menus.
