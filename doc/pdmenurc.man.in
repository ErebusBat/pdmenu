.SH NAME
pdmenurc \- menu definitions file for pdmenu
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/pdmenurc
.PP
.B ~/.pdmenurc
.SH DESCRIPTION
The pdmenurc file defines menus for
.BR pdmenu (1)
to display. Each menu consists of one or more menu entries. 
The first menu to appear in the file is displayed by
.BR pdmenu (1)
when it starts up, and can have menu entries that call up submenus.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is a sample pdmenurc file:
.PP
 #Set a pleasing color scheme.
 color:desktop:blue:blue
 color:title:blue:white
 color:base:blue:white

 #this is a comment
 menu:main:Main Menu:Things to do at foobar
      show:_Games..::games
      exec:_Mail::pine
      exec:_News::slrn -C
      exec:_WWW::lynx
      exec:_Irc::irc
      exec:_Directory _Listing:display:ls -l
      exec:_Who's online?:truncate:w
      exec:_Finger:edit,truncate:finger ~finger who?:~
      nop
      exit:E_xit
        
 menu:games:Games:Some text-based games
     exec:_Tetris for Terminals::/usr/games/tt
     exec:_Adventure:pause:/usr/games/adventure
     exec:_Zork:pause:/usr/games/zork
     nop
     exit:_Back to main menu..

This will display a menu, with a submenu for games.
.SH FORMAT
.BR pdmenu (1)
doesn't care how the pdmenurc is indented; all whitespace is ignored.
However, each command must be on its own line. The commands are grouped into
two classes: those that appear only in menus, and those that can appear
anywhere in the file.
.SS COMMANDS THAT MAY BE USED ANYWHERE
These commands may appear in a menu, or outside of a menu. They take effect
as soon as 
.BR pdmenu (1)
sees them.
.TP
menu
This starts a menu. All items between this menu command and the next will
comprise one menu. If a menu with the same id has already been defined
earlier, then all items between this menu command and the next will be added
to the menu.
The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fImenu:menuid:title[:helptext]\fR
.TP
menuid
The id of the menu (each menu must have a unique id).
.TP
title
The title of the menu.
.TP
helptext
Text to be displayed at the bottom of the screen when the menu is active.
.RE
.TP
title
This overrides the default title at the top of the screen. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fItitle:text\fR
.RE
.TP
color
This changes the color of a part of the display.
Later color commands override earlier color commands that would affect 
the same part of the display. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIcolor:screenpart:foreground[:background]\fR
.TP
screenpart
The area of the screen which takes on the selected color scheme.
Areas of the screen that can be set are:
.RS
.TP
desktop
The space over which the menus appear.
.TP
title
The line at the top of the screen.
.TP
base
The line at the bottom of the screen.
.TP
menu
The normal color of text in a menu.
.TP
selbar
The selection bar in the menu, when over normal text.
.TP
shadow
The shadow of a window
.TP
menuhot
The color of text in a menu that is a hotkey.
.TP
selbarhot
The color of a hotkey when the selection bar is over it.
.TP
unselmenu
The color of a menu window that is not currently active.
.RE
.TP
foreground
The color to use in the foreground. Valid colors are:
.RS
 black           gray
 red             brightred
 green           brightgreen
 brown           yellow
 blue            brightblue
 magenta         brightmagenta
 cyan            brightcyan
 lightgray       white
.RE
.PP
.TP
background
The color to use in the background.  On most terminals, the
background color can only be one of the colors listed in the first
column above.
.RE
.TP
read
This causes another menu definitions file to be read in and replace the
read command.
This is quite similar to #include in a c program. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIread:rcfile\fR
.PP
Note that no checking is done to prevent recursive read commands, and that
such a recursive command can crash pdmenu.
.RE
.TP
preproc
This runs a command, and uses its output as a pdmenurc file, which is read 
in and replaces the preproc command. Typically a preprocessor such as m4 
or cpp will be used. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIpreproc:command [args]\fR
.PP
Note that no checking is done to prevent recursive preproc commands, and
that
such a recursive command can crash pdmenu.
.RE
.SS COMMANDS THAT MUST APPEAR INSIDE MENUS
These commands must always appear within a menu. They are only executed if
the user selects them from the menu.
.TP
show
This displays a submenu. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIshow:desc:flags:menuid\fR
.TP
menuid
The id of the menu to show, corresponding to the menuid given in the 
menu's definition.
.TP
desc
The description of the submenu to appear in the parent window. 
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put a '_' before the character you 
want to become the hotkey. It is a good idea to differentiate submenus 
from commands in a menu by, for example, appending ".." to their 
descriptions.
.RE
.IP flags 
Currently ignored.
.IP
.RE
.TP
nop
This does nothing but place a blank line in the menu. Nop commands may not
appear as the first command in a menu.
Syntax:
.RS
.PP
\fInop[:text]\fR
.TP
text
If this is present, it will appear in the menu where the nop is. Otherwise,
the nop in the menu will be a blank line.
.RE
.TP
helptext
This changes the helptext of the currently displayed menu. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIhelptext:desc:flags:help text\fR
.TP
desc
The text to appear on the menu.
.TP
flags
Currently the only available flag is "command", which makes the help text
be read in from a command in the help text field, instead of using the
literal value of the field. The first line the command outputs becomes the
new help text.
.RE
.TP
exit
If only one menu is on the screen when this is selected, then 
.BR pdmenu (1)
will quit. Otherwise, this will take the user back to the parent menu of the 
menu they are currently in. Selecting an exit command in a menu is equivalent 
to pressing 'q', unless you have ran 
.BR pdmenu (1) 
with the \-q switch. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIexit:desc\fR
.TP
desc
The description of the menu item.
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put 
a '_' before the character you want to become the hotkey.
.RE
.RE
.TP
group
This creates a menu entry that can run multiple commands at the same
time. After the group command, list the commands that make up the group.
Close the group with the \fIendgroup\fP command. When the group is selected
from the menu, each command in the group will be run, in turn. Note that if
a group caintains an exit command, processing will stop there even if there
are more commands in the group. Group commands may not be nested. The syntax
is:
.RS
.PP
\fIgroup:desc\fR
.TP
desc
The description of the menu item.
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put
a '_' before the character you want to become the hotkey.
.RE
.RE
.TP
endgroup
This closes a \fIgroup\fP command. Every command between the opening group
command and the endgroup comprises a group of commands.
.TP
exec
This runs a command. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIexec:desc:flags:command\fR
.TP
command
The actual command to run when this item is selected.
.RS
.PP
Normally,
.BR pdmenu (1)
passes the command to
.BR system (3)
for exacution.  However, if the first token of the command is "exec", then the
command is executed directly with the
.BR execvp (3)
system call.  As such, the 
.BR pdmenu (1)
process is wholly replaced by the command.
.RE
.TP
desc
The description of the command that appears in the menu.
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put a '_' before the character 
you want to become the hotkey.
.RE
.TP
flags 
How to run this command, and what to do with its output. Any number of
the following flags can be specified, in any order, separated by commas.
(for example, "display,edit")
.RS
.PP
Some of the flags conflict with each over, for example, 'display'
and 'pause' cannot both be used at the same time. If conflicting flags are
specified, Pdmenu will just pick one of them and use it.
.PP
Note that to maintain backward compatability with old versions of Pdmenu, the
flags can be formatted differently: as a sequence of characters, each
character a flag and corrisponding to the first character of the long flag
name, and nothing separating the characters. However, this format is
obsolete and hard to understand, and should no longer be used.
.TP
noclear
By default the screen is cleared and the terminal is reset to normal before
.BR pdmenu (1)
runs a command from the menu, and after the command exits, the screen is 
redrawn. If this flag is set, the screen is not cleared or
redrawn. Use it if you have a command on the menu that does not produce any
output to the screen. (Conflicts with: 'pause')
.TP
pause
Pause after the command exits. Use this if you need to see the output of the
command. (Conflicts with: 'noclear', 'display', 'truncate', 'makemenu',
and 'setenv')
.TP
display
Display the output of the command in a window. If this flag is set, the 'pause'
flag is disabled, and the 'noclear' flag is automatically set. 
If the command outputs lines that are too long, they will be wrapped 
inside the window. (Conflicts with: 'pause', 'truncate', 'makemenu', 'setenv')
.TP
truncate
Like 'display', except the output of the command is truncated to fit in the
window, not wrapped.
(Conflicts with: 'pause', 'display', 'mmakemenu', 'setenv')
.TP
edit
Edit the command interactively.
.RS
.PP
When this flag is set, the command to be run is scanned for any tags of the
format \fI~title:default~\fR. For each that is found, a text entry window is
displayed, with the title equal to the contents of the title field, and the
default text equal to the contents of the default field. 
.PP
To use the '~' or ':' characters in the command without having them 
interpreted as tag delimiters, escape them with a '\e' character. 
(Ie, '\e~' and '\e:')
.PP
\fISecurity warning!\fR Any exec command that uses the 'edit' flag will be
a security hole. The user need only to enter text with a ';' in it, and
they can run an arbitrary command after the semicolon!
.PP
There is no fix for this security problem at this time. If the user running
.BR pdmenu (1)
is not a trusted user (if they are a guest user, say), do not allow 
them access to any exec commands that have the 'edit' flag set. 
.RE
.TP
makemenu
This flag lets you generate menus on the fly as 
.BR pdmenu (1)
is running. It runs
the command, then processes the output of the command as if it were a
pdmenurc file.
.RS
.PP
Here is a sample use of this flag. It creates a menu of people who are
logged on, and lets you talk to one of them. Notice the use of 
\fIremove\fP to clear the menu after we use it.
.PP
  group:_Talk
    exec::makemenu: \\
      echo "menu:talk:Talk"; \\
      for u in `users`; do \\
        echo "exec:$u::talk $u"; \\
      done
    show:::talk
    remove:::talk
  endgroup
.PP
(Conflicts with: 'display', 'truncate', 'pause', 'display', 'setenv')
.RE
.TP
setenv
Set an environment variable.
.RS
.PP
This flag causes 
.BR pdmenu (1)
to set a variable in its own environment. 
.BR pdmenu (1)
runs the exec command, and looks at the command's output. The first line 
should be in the format 
.RS
VAR=value
.RE
Where VAR is the environment variable to set, and value is the new value
for the variable. 
.PP
For example, use "echo PWD=/tmp" to set the current working
directory to /tmp. (Conflicts with: 'makemenu', 'display', 'truncate',
and 'pause')
.RE
.RE
.RE
.TP
remove
This removes a menu from Pdmenu's list of menus. You should never attempt to
remove a menu that is currently being displayed on screen. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIremove:desc:flags:menuid\fR
.PP
.TP
desc
The description of the command that appears in the menu.
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put a '_' before the character
you want to become the hotkey.
.RE
.TP
flags
Currently ignored.
.TP
menuid
The id of the menu to remove. If the menu wih id \fImenuid\fR does not exist,
no error is reported.
.PP
This command is typically used after creating and using a new menu via the 
 'makemenu' flag to \fIexec\fR, to remove a menu that is no longer needed.
For example, if you have the followng pdmenurc:

 menu:main:Main Menu
   group:_Test
     exec::makemenu: \\
       echo menu:sample:Dir; \\
       echo exec:_Directory:pause:ls
     show:::sample
   endgroup

Each time the user selects "Test" from the Main Menu, the menu that
appears has another Directory command on it. If you don't want this
to happen, and you want only one Directory command to be on the menu,
add a command to remove the menu after it is used, like this:

 menu:main:Main Menu
   group:_Test
     exec::makemenu: \\
       echo menu:sample:Dir; \\
       echo exec:_Directory:pause:ls
     show:::sample
     remove:::sample
   endgroup

.SH NOTES
If a line ends with '\\', 
.BR pdmenu (1)
will read in the next line as part of the same logical line.
.PP
If you want the ':' character to appear in a field, you may escape out 
the ':' character by placing '\\' before it. You don't need to do this if
the field is the last field in a line.
