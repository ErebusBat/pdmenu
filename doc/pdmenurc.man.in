.SH NAME
pdmenurc \- menu definitions file for pdmenu
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/pdmenurc
.PP
.B ~/.pdmenurc
.SH DESCRIPTION
The pdmenurc file defines menus for
.BR pdmenu (1)
to display. Each menu consists of one or more menu entries. 
The first menu to appear in the file is displayed by
.BR pdmenu (1)
when it starts up, and can have menu entries that call up submenus.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is a sample pdmenurc file:
.PP
 #Set a pleasing color scheme.
 color:desktop:blue:blue
 color:title:blue:white
 color:base:blue:white

 #this is a comment
 menu:main:Main Menu:Things to do at foobar
      show:_Games..::games
      exec:_Mail::pine
      exec:_News::slrn -C
      exec:_WWW::lynx
      exec:_Irc::irc
      exec:_Directory _Listing:dn:ls -l
      exec:_Who's online?:d:w
      exec:_Finger:ed:finger ~finger who?:~
      exit:E_xit
        
 menu:games:Games:Some text-based games
     exec:_Tetris for Terminals::/usr/games/tt
     exec:_Adventure::/usr/games/adventure
     exec:_Zork::/usr/games/zork
     nop
     exit:_Back to main menu..

This will display a menu, with a submenu for games.
.SH FORMAT
.BR pdmenu (1)
doesn't care how the pdmenurc is indented; all whitespace is ignored.
However, each command must be on its own line.
.TP 
nop
This does nothing but place a blank line in the menu. Nop commands may not
appear as the first command in a menu.
Syntax:
.RS
.PP
\fInop[:text]\fR
.TP
text
If this is present, it will appear in the menu where the nop is. Otherwise,
the nop in the menu will be a blank line.
.RE
.TP
menu
This starts a menu. All items between this menu command and the next will
comprise one menu. If a menu by the same name has already been defined
earlier, then all items between this menu command and the next will be added
to the menu. It is illegal to have a menu without any commands in it.
The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fImenu:menuname:title[:helptext]\fR
.TP
menuname
The name of the menu (each menu must have a unique name).
.TP
title
The title of the menu.
.TP
helptext
Text to be displayed at the bottom of the screen when the menu is active.
.RE
.TP
show
This displays a submenu. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIshow:desc:flags:menuname\fR
.TP
menuname
The name of the menu to show, corresponding to the menuname given in the 
menu's definition.
.TP
desc
The description of the submenu to appear in the parent window. 
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put a '_' before the character you 
want to become the hotkey. It is a good idea to differentiate submenus 
from commands in a menu by, for example, appending ".." to their 
descriptions.
.RE
.IP flags 
Currently ignored.
.IP
.RE
.TP
exit
If only one menu is on the screen when this is selected, then 
.BR pdmenu (1)
will quit. Otherwise, this will take the user back to the parent menu of the 
menu they are currently in. Selecting an exit command in a menu is equivalent 
to pressing 'q', unless you have ran 
.BR pdmenu (1) 
with the \-q switch. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIexit:desc\fR
.TP
desc
The description of the menu item.
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put 
a '_' before the character you want to become the hotkey.
.RE
.RE
.TP
exec
This runs a command. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIexec:desc:flags:command\fR
.TP
command
The actual command to run when this item is selected.
.TP
desc
The description of the command that appears in the menu.
.RS
.PP
To place a hotkey in the description, put a '_' before the character 
you want to become the hotkey.
.RE
.TP
flags 
How to run this command, and what to do with its output. Any number of
the following flags can be specified, in any order.
.RS
.TP
n
By default the screen is cleared and the terminal is reset to normal before
.BR pdmenu (1)
runs a command from the menu, and after the command exits, the screen is 
redrawn. If this 'n' flag is set, the screen is not cleared or
redrawn. Use it if you have a command on the menu that does not produce any
output to the screen.
.TP
p
Pause after the command exits. Use this if you need to see the output of the
command.
.TP
d
Display the output of the command in a window. If this flag is set, the 'p'
flag is disabled, and the 'n' flag is automatically set.
.TP
e
Edit the command interactively.
.RS
.PP
When this flag is set, the command to be run is scanned for any tags of the
format \fI~title:default~\fR. For each that is found, a text entry window is
displayed, with the title equal to the contents of the title field, and the
default text equal to the contents of the default field. 
.PP
To use the '~' or ':' characters in the command without having them 
interpreted as tag delimiters, escape them with a '\e' character. 
(Ie, '\e~' and '\e:')
.PP
\fISecurity warning!\fR Any exec command that uses the 'e' flag will be
a security hole. The user need only to enter text with a ';' in it, and
they can run an arbitrary command after the semicolon!
.PP
There is no fix for this security problem at this time. If the user running
.BR pdmenu (1)
is not a trusted user (if they are a guest user, say), do not allow 
them access to any exec commands that have the 'e' flag set. 
.RE
.TP
s
Set an environment variable.
.RS
.PP
This flag causes 
.BR pdmenu (1)
to set a variable in its own environment. 
.BR pdmenu (1)
runs the exec command, and looks at the command's output. The first line 
should be in the format 
.RS
VAR=value
.RE
Where VAR is the environment variable to set, and value is the new value
for the variable. 
.PP
For example, use "echo PWD=/tmp" to set the current working
directory to /tmp.
.PP
\fISecurity warning!\fR This flag could be a serious security hole. Use with 
caution.
.RE
.RE
.RE
.TP
color
This changes the color of a part of the display. Color commands are read in
and executed when the menu file is loaded. Later color commands override earlier
color commands that would affect the same part of the display. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIcolor:screenpart:foreground[:background]\fR
.TP
screenpart
The area of the screen which takes on the selected color scheme.
Areas of the screen that can be set are:
.RS
.TP
desktop
The space over which the menus appear.
.TP
title
The line at the top of the screen.
.TP
base
The line at the bottom of the screen.
.TP
menu
The normal color of text in a menu.
.TP
selbar
The selection bar in the menu, when over normal text.
.TP
shadow
The shadow of a window
.TP
menuhot
The color of text in a menu that is a hotkey.
.TP
selbarhot
The color of a hotkey when the selection bar is over it.
.RE
.TP
foreground
The color to use in the foreground. Valid colors are:
.RS
 black           gray
 red             brightred
 green           brightgreen
 brown           yellow
 blue            brightblue
 magenta         brightmagenta
 cyan            brightcyan
 lightgray       white
.RE
.PP
.TP
background
The color to use in the background.  On most terminals, the
background color can only be one of the colors listed in the first 
column above.
.RE
.TP
read
This causes another menu definitions file to be read in and replace the
read command.
This is quite similar to #include in a c program. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIread:rcfile\fR
.PP
Note that no checking is done to prevent recursive read commands, and that
such a recursive command can crash pdmenu.
.RE
.TP
preproc
This runs a command, and uses it's output as a rc file, which is read in and
replaces the preproc command. Typically a preprocessor such as m4 or cpp
will be used. The syntax is:
.RS
.PP
\fIpreproc:command [args]\fR
.PP
Note that no checking is done to prevent recursive preproc commands, and that
such a recursive command can crash pdmenu.
.SH FILES
.I @PDMENU_SYSCONFDIR@/pdmenurc
.RS
Default config file.
.RE
.I ~/.pdmenurc
.RS
If this exists, it overrides @PDMENU_SYSCONFDIR@/pdmenurc.
