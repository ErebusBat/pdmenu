This is a collection of sample pdmenurc files for Pdmenu and support files
for the rc's:

pdmenurc         - A simple pdmenurc file for beginners to modify
pdmenurc.monitor - An example of a pdmenurc file I use to display system
                   monitoring info on a dumb terminal.
pdmenurc.complex - Shows off advanced features of the pdmenurc file, and how
                   to accomplish some neat tricks in a pdmenurc file.
showdir.pl       - Used in pdmenurc.complex. Pass it a directory name as a
                   parameter, it outputs a pdmenurc file to standard output 
                   that shows the files in the directory and lets the user 
                   change to other directories and view files.

If you have an interesting pdmenurc, please send it to joey@kite.ml.org for
inclusion here.
