#!@PDMENU_BINDIR@/pdmenu

# Note that the above bang-path isn't required, but it lets you run this
# file directly as a sort of pdmenu script.

# this pdmenurc file is adapted from the default /etc/pdmenurc and
# other example files, and is put together with the newbie linux user
# in mind; i'm trying to provide him/her with as many tools as
# possible.  it was originally constructed for a couple who were given
# a 386 by a friend.  with linux and pdmenu, i was able to turn it
# into a respectible internet machine.

# make it useful to your new unix user, and send any feedback to
