# This pdmenurc shows off the more complicated things that can be done with
# Pdmenu. If you get lost, see the pdmenurc(5) man page, or the simpler
# pdmenurc files.

# Define the main menu.
# Note the use of the preproc command to put the hostname in the menu title.

	# Let's display a list of files in the current directory. Let the
	# user navigate around by hitting enter on subdirectories. Let them
	# display a file simply by hitting enter on it.
	# The showdir script can be in different places, depending on if
	# pdmenu has been installed yet or not, which is why I try running
	# it three different ways.
